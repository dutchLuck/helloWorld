# helloWorld
This code started out as Git newbie test drive code;
I have used RCS as a version control method, but it appears git is
the present and at least the near future. I have also used this
code to try out git's Actions to see what advantages the git provided
tools may have, even though this code is rather trivial.

This code has been expanded a number of times to test out
aspects of compiler configuration or operation. For example
it outputs a list of Pre-defined values known by the c compiler.

If this code is compiled with a -DCLOCKS options 
the code will output the resolution of various clocks
and timers provided by the compiler in combination
with the operating system.
